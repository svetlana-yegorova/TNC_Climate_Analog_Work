# TNC_Climate_Analog_Work
Code for TNC's future forest distribution internship

This project uses climate analogs, defined using reference (1981-2010) and future (2040-2070) period evapotranspiraton and climatic water deficit, to map areas where forests are expected to grow and to be absent in the future. 

File "directory.R" in the "code" folder explains what each R script does, and lays out the sequence in which the scripts could be run. It is the "readme" file for the project.
