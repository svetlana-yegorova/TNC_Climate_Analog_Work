# TNC_Climate_Analog_Work
Code for TNC's future forest distribution internship

This project uses climate analogs, defined using reference (1981-2010) and future (2040-2070) period evapotranspiraton and climatic water deficit, to map areas where forests are expected to grow and to be absent in the future.
